## 🔄 If Server Stopped

If the server is not running, restart it:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\narayana\AI Projects\AIConsulting\tcs-sdlc-workflow"
npm run dev
```

Server will start on http://localhost:3001 (or 3000 if available)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
- **Symptom:** Server says port 3000 in use
- **Solution:** Already handled - using port 3001

### Page Not Found (404)
- **Symptom:** Navigation link doesn't work
- **Solution:** Server may still be starting, wait 30 seconds

### Data Not Updating
- **Symptom:** Maturity level switch doesn't change data
- **Solution:** Check browser console, may need hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Server Won't Start
- **Symptom:** `npm run dev` fails
- **Solution:**
  ```bash
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

## 🎓 Understanding the Enhancements

### What Changed?
- **Before:** Single workflow visualization page
- **After:** 4-page enterprise platform with governance, security, cost management

### Why These Pages?
1. **AI Operations** - Addresses "observability" gap from a16z
2. **Governance** - Addresses "human oversight" and "compliance" gaps
3. **Cost Management** - Addresses "cost optimization" gap

### What Didn't Change?
- ✅ Existing Vercel deployment (untouched)
- ✅ Original workflow map (enhanced, not replaced)
- ✅ All existing components and data
