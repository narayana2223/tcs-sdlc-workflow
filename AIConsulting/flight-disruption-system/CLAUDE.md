docker system prune -f

# Verify environment variables
cat .env

# Check service dependencies
docker-compose ps
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connectivity
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready

# Check connection limits
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U flight_user -d flight_disruption -c "SHOW max_connections;"
```

### AI Prediction Issues
```bash
# Verify API keys
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
echo $WEATHER_API_KEY

# Check prediction service logs
docker-compose logs disruption-predictor

# Test prediction endpoint
curl -X GET http://localhost:8001/health
```

### Kafka Issues
```bash
# Check Kafka topics
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

# Monitor consumer lag
docker-compose exec kafka kafka-consumer-groups --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --all-groups
```

### UI Development Issues
```bash
# Tailwind CSS class not found errors (recently resolved)
# If you encounter "The `text-[color]-800` class does not exist" errors:

# 1. Check tailwind.config.js has all required color variants:
#    - primary: 50, 100, 200, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900
#    - success: 50, 100, 200, 500, 600, 700, 800
#    - warning: 50, 100, 200, 500, 600, 700, 800
#    - danger: 50, 100, 200, 500, 600, 700, 800

# 2. Clear Next.js cache and restart dev server:
cd services/passenger-portal
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
npm run dev

# 3. Kill processes using port if needed:
netstat -ano | findstr :3002
cmd //c taskkill //PID [PID_NUMBER] //F
```
