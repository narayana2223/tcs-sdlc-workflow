## 🧠 Autonomous Intelligence Features

### **Visible Agent Reasoning**

Each agent shows transparent decision-making:

```
🔮 PredictionAgent: Weather data indicates 78% probability of fog at LHR by 14:30. 
   Confidence: [████████  ] 84%
   Reasoning: Weather correlation → Historical patterns → Model prediction → Risk assessment

👥 PassengerAgent: Analyzing 1,247 affected passengers. Priority ranking complete.
   Confidence: [███████   ] 76%  
   Reasoning: Tier status analysis → Connection risk evaluation → EU261 compliance → Rebooking strategy

💰 FinanceAgent: Cost optimization complete. Projected savings: £156,300 vs traditional approach.
   Confidence: [█████████ ] 91%
   Reasoning: Market analysis → Vendor negotiation → Cost-benefit calculation → ROI optimization
```

### **Agent-to-Agent Collaboration**

Agents autonomously initiate collaborations:

```
🤝 AGENT COLLABORATION: cost_optimization
Participants: FinanceAgent, ResourceAgent, PassengerAgent

[14:23] 💰 FinanceAgent: Hotel costs exceed budget by 23%. Seeking cost reduction strategies.
        Confidence: 87%

[14:23] 🏨 ResourceAgent: Alternative accommodation available at 18% savings. Quality impact: minimal.
        Confidence: 82%

[14:24] 👥 PassengerAgent: Passenger satisfaction maintained with proposed alternatives. Approval granted.
        Confidence: 79%

[14:24] 💰 FinanceAgent: Collaboration successful. Total savings: £28,400. Implementing solution.
        Confidence: 94%
```

### **Autonomous Conflict Resolution**

When agents disagree, the system resolves conflicts automatically:

```
⚖️ CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Resource Allocation Priority

Conflicting Agents: PassengerAgent vs FinanceAgent
Issue: Premium accommodation vs budget constraints

Resolution Process:
1. Analyzed passenger impact scores
2. Evaluated regulatory compliance requirements
3. Applied cost-benefit analysis  
4. Determined optimal priority ranking

✅ CONSENSUS ACHIEVED: Balanced approach prioritizing compliance with cost optimization
```

### **Real-time Learning**

Agents continuously learn from outcomes:

```
🧠 LEARNING EVENT: FinanceAgent
Decision Context: Hotel rate negotiation for 340 passengers
Predicted Outcome: 15% savings, £25,000 total cost
Actual Outcome: 22% savings, £23,100 total cost
Feedback Score: 0.94

Key Lesson: Dynamic pricing negotiations during high-demand periods yield 7% additional savings
Model Update: Negotiation confidence threshold increased by 0.06
```
